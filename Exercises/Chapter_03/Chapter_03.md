The following are valid variable names.
```  
Int  
Calloc  
floaitng  
ReInitialize  
Xx  
_1312  
_  
alpha_beta_routine  
z  
```  
Examples of invalid variable names are the following.
```  
char	// a keyword describing a type in C
6_05	// variablnames are not allowed to start with a digit
```  
The last variable named `A$` is not a valid name because of the dollar sign. Note that this variable name can often be used anyway, because of compiler extensions that extends the original C standard.
