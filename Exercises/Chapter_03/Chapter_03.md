# Exercise Solutions Chapter 3 #
## 1. ##
Test run of the 5 programs presented in this chapter.  
 - [program_03_01.c](Exercise_01/Program_03_01/program_03_01.c)  
 - [program_03_02.c](Exercise_01/Program_03_02/program_03_02.c)  
 - [program_03_03.c](Exercise_01/Program_03_03/program_03_03.c)  
 - [program_03_04.c](Exercise_01/Program_03_04/program_03_04.c)  
 - [program_03_05.c](Exercise_01/Program_03_05/program_03_05.c)

The following are valid variable names.
```  
Int  
Calloc  
floaitng  
ReInitialize  
Xx  
_1312  
_  
alpha_beta_routine  
z  
```  
Examples of invalid variable names are the following.
```  
char	// a keyword describing a type in C
6_05	// variablnames are not allowed to start with a digit
```  
The last variable in this exercise is named `A$` this is not a valid name because of the dollar sign. It should however be noted that this variable name can often be used anyway. This is because of compiler extensions that extends the original C standard.
